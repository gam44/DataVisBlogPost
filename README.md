### Art Piece 1

In this piece of art, Craig Taylor uses a coral metaphor to visualize road networks in major cities around the world. The pieces of "coral" are derived from various geo-spatial analysis of drive-times catchments. I was really drawn to this piece because of the juxtaposition between something very natural and beautiful with a very man-made system like roads networks. On the other hand, I could see a connection between how a network of roads is used to build a living and breathing creature - a city.  I also really loved the colors Taylor used to add more depth to the coral.

### Art Piece 2

I was really drawn to this piece of art because of the way it combined this "truthiness" information with an aesthetically pleasing gradiant of pink and blue. As you click on each movie scene from left to right, the artist explains what the historical movie presents and how much that actually reflects reality. I found it really fun to scroll through the different scenes and read the information, which was presented in a very clear and interactive way. The colors add an extra piece of fun as you toggle between the levels of truth.
