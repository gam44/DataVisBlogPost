### Art Piece 1

I was really drawn to this piece because of Taylor's use of a very unnatural network - a road network - to form a beautiful, natural creature - coral. I thought the idea and this juxtaposition was fascinating, and his color choices add a real depth to the coral. On the other hand, I could see how the art's data and form are actually quite interwined, as a network of roads could be seen as making up a living, beating creature - a city. As you watch the coral grow, you can see the networks expanding and imagine the people traveling along those lines to connect with each other. It is a very powerful image.

### Art Piece 2

I found this piece to be both very information and interesting as well as aesethically pleasing. As you scroll across the bar on the screen, you dive into different shades of blue and pink that lead you to the various historical movie's scene. The colors depend on the scene's level of historical accuracy, and I loved scrolling through the different scenes to both explore the different colors portrayed within the gradient as well as to learn more about the movie.
