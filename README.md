### Art Piece 1
![Jeremy Blake](images/The_Witchs_Cap.png?raw=true "Jeremy Blake")
The pieces of art below were created by Jeremy Blake, a new media artist that passed away in 2007. The first image, The Witchâ€™s Cap, is a digital c-print. This image stood out to me because it looks like it might either be a photoraph or even a painting, but it is neither. I thought that the way in which the yellow and pink lines framed the picture make it seem as though the image features a street or an alley way. Lining this alley are the images of the masked woman, the house, the landscape, the rose, etc. as screens on a wall. To me, it is easy to imagine someone walking down that path, being engulfed by the futuristic, flashing, and distracting images that are relentlessly forced into their vision.
